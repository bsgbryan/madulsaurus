## Initialize

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
mkdir madul-example && cd $_
bun init
bun i @tsconfig/bun @tsconfig/node-lts bun-types
bun i @bsgbryan/madul
```

### Why [Bun](https://bun.sh)?

Bun is an all-in-one toolkit for JavaScript and TypeScript apps. It ships as a single executable called `bunâ€‹`.

At its core is the Bun runtime, a fast JavaScript runtime designed as a drop-in replacement for Node.js. It's written in Zig and powered by JavaScriptCore under the hood, dramatically reducing startup times and memory usage.

The bunâ€‹ command-line tool also implements a test runner, script runner, and Node.js-compatible package manager, all significantly faster than existing tools and usable in existing Node.js projects with little to no changes necessary.
